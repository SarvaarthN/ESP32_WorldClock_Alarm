# 12 Hr Clock

This project is a **Digital Logic Design (Sem 3) course project at VJTI**, focused on the design and implementation of a non-microcontroller-based digital clock using fundamental digital electronics components.

A **crystal oscillator** is employed to generate a stable and accurate clock signal, which is then divided and processed using a series of decade counters to achieve precise timekeeping.

The clock is configured to operate in a 12-hour format, incorporating appropriate rollover logic for hours. **Seven-segment display driver ICs** are used to interface with the displays, ensuring clear and reliable visualization of hours and minutes.

This project emphasizes a deep understanding of frequency division, time counting, sequential logic, and display interfacing, demonstrating accurate timekeeping without relying on microcontrollers or firmware, and instead leveraging core digital logic design principles.
