# ESP32 World Clock and Alarm

This project is a **Digital Logic Design (Sem 3) course project at VJTI**, showcasing the implementation of a world clock and alarm system using an ESP32. 
It utilizes a **4-digit 7-segment display** to show time and demonstrates the use of **combinational circuits** such as BCD to 7-segment decoders. 
The system highlights both hardware design principles and firmware control for a practical embedded application.
